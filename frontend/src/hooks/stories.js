        &ldquo;A user story is short, specific and goal-oriented. It is a
        one-sentence statement that tends to have the following structure: “As a
        X, I want Y so that Z occurs”. Based on persona, describe the path the
        user takes from initial qualifying event to finding recovery, attending
        and organizing meetings.&rdquo; -{" "}

          As an newcomer, I want to find recovery tools, whether that be in the
          form of meetings, literature, videos or podcasts, methods or
          techniques, so that I can be better educated to deal with my
          addictions, to start recovery and begin the healing process.

        <li>
          As an attendee, I want to be notified of upcoming workshops or
          conferences that I might be interested in attending so that I can
          discover new paths or areas that I want to heal within myself.
