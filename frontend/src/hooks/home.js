          The pandemic has disrupted our way of living, how we connect to others
          through being present emotionally and physically.
        </p>
        <p>
          It has created isolation, despair and fear. For those that were on the
          path to recovery, suddenly being diverted off, needing to find their
          way.
        </p>
        <p>
          The pandemic has also revealed the need to still connect, even more
          now than ever. The engine being in-person meetings which provided a
          safe space to hear other stories that mirrored my own. To know that I
          wasnâ€™t alone in my journey.
        </p>
        <p>
          For those that suffer in silence, please know that you are not alone.

          To create a safe and secure platform for all to share personal stories
          of recovery, become involved with our communities through service,
          guiding others through sponsorship, and supporting our local and
          global communities through charitable donation.
