Today I have a quality of life which is beyond description. A life that is worry-free. A life that is hard to describe to a lot of people who would not understand unless they are enjoying such a life. This has come about by living the 12 Steps of Alcoholics Anonymous in my life each day in all my affairs. It is a way of life that allows me to be comfortable with myself and friendly and loving in my relationship with my family and people in general.\n\nMy life before AA was one of chaos and unreliability. I believe my father was an alcoholic and my mother a child of an alcoholic. Both of them were beautiful people, but I do believe I was affected by growing up in that environment. I don’t believe that caused me to be an alcoholic but I do believe that it caused me problems because of some of the attitudes I learned on the way. I was a fairly religious person as a child and even in my active alcoholism, but I found it very hard to serve two masters.\n\nEven though I was religious, I adored a God of fear and ultimately, I think, I adored the church rather than a loving God. I seemed to get in a fair bit of trouble as a child, although I never intended to; often it just seemed to happen. I wasn’t a willful child and I tried to do the right thing. I had four brothers and we fought a lot, but I had a fairly happy childhood although deprived of a lot of material things. My parents tried to give us love but I don’t believe they knew a lot about that.\n\nI believe I was an alcoholic before I picked up my first drink. My life was certainly unmanageable long before I drank. When I was confirmed I took the pledge not to drink until I turned 21 – not that I thought there was too much wrong with drinking. I was an Altar Boy who altered! I can remember drinking the altar wine and going back for more, but not drinking too much in case Father found out. I wasn’t aware that it was an alcoholic wine and I didn’t think the Father would drink alcoholic wine. Anyway, I was confused, and it is obvious to see I remember the feeling it gave me, which I liked and was why I kept going back.","shared":"2020-09-23T06:23:42.260Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6aea365b05ae0017cb2569","user":"5f6adc8418a4da00176aeb72","title":"Her marriage was disintegrating","body":"My story goes back 26 years when, at the age of 16 and being a little chubby, my father made the comment that I was getting very fat and looked like a slob. This triggered a negative response in my head and I was determined he would never say that again after I had spent a lot of my childhood fighting overweight. I made a conscious decision to do something about it, which ultimately led to anorexia, although it was not called that in those days and very little was known about it, then to bulimia and finally alcoholism at the ripe old age of 21.","shared":"2020-09-23T06:24:54.113Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5f6aea7b5b05ae0017cb256a","user":"5f6adc5f18a4da00176aeb71","title":"Self Care","body":"I will do nothing against the will of my heart.\n(xejn kontra qalbi)\n\nI will do everything to keep myself well in order not to have migraines.\n\nI will close the door.\nI will not communicate by cell phone, internet, conversation, with anyone who is toxic for me.\nI will not give opinions, or judgements about their lives.
