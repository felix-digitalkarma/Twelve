# Twelve
Prelude
The pandemic has disrupted our way of living, how we connect to others through being present emotionally and physically. It has created isolation, despair and fear. For those that were on the path to recovery, suddenly being diverted off, needing to find their way.

The pandemic has also revealed the need to still connect, even more now than ever. Our previous platform was in-person meeting based which provided a safe space to hear other stories that mirrored my own. To know that I wasn’t alone in my journey. 

It has also revealed the need for a modern digital solution, as most meetings were binder-based, laminated sheets so the next person that did service could lead in a predictable way.   There are current existing Zoom meetings however since the pandemic, i believe that finding those meetings are a challenge within themselves. From initial research, most meeting information is outdated as some indicate the meeting location as physical. There is also a difference in how each group disperse information about their specific path of recovery (da, coda, aa).

During my path of recovery, I noticed that the various problems in my life required a different group. I would have a hard time making time for different recovery group interaction juggling with work. There were various groups in my personal life that I’ve attended, AA, CoDA, Children of AA, Debtors Anonymous. Feels like the Divergence sci-fi trilogy...feeling like I apply to more than just one path of recovery. 

Sharing my story
I had a difficult time managing, trying to control those aspects of my life. I was unwilling to admit defeat. What it meant to see failure for what it was. I’ve realized I’ve woven my personal and professional aspects of my life together tightly. I feared failure because there was no other option than punishment. I didn’t see that there were other options I could’ve taken. When I was failing on a project at work, I had thoughts of growing up and my father trying to teach me to drive. I was so scared of doing the wrong thing, to show failure in front of my father. That’s also shown my poor boundaries with work and personal life (Coda).  I was also unwilling to accept help from others that gave freely. I was also afraid to set firm boundaries when I was in conflict. (Children of AA). I had problems managing my credit, being trustworthy with my financial obligations (Debtors Anonymous).





Twelve.org Application - Community based online representation.

Profiles involved:
Service vs Non-Service

Service Positions Required
Transfer of responsibility for those with admin access
Finding / contacting speakers easily through volunteer availability

Amazon listed items - literature
Provides distribution through shipping

Recordings of Meetings for sale - speakers per month


Output of sales could go to group-defined charities or community support providing economic relief. Speakers would be able to define charity. This would incentivise speaker involvement, ie. sharing stories. This would also require possible permission from defined charities in the system. Anonymity is paramount.

Interaction from viewers would include a means to contribute, whether financially (donations), be put on a speaker list so they could also be involved in the charity (giving through participation).

Through joint community involvement, we lift together.
